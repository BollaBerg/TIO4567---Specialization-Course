\section{Assessment criteria}
\label{sec:criteria}

The results from the search conducted in \autoref{sec:criteria-selection} were combined to create a set of assessment criteria for the selected papers. These criteria are listed in \autoref{tab:criteria}, alongside the sources they are based on. As the criteria are based on guides for both writing and evaluating academic papers, these make a nice, well-rounded framework for evaluating whether the selected articles present and use research questions the way they should.
