\section{Conclusion}
% None of the papers explicitly stated their research questions
% Still clear connection between research goal and results (and PRQs)
% Some may argue RQs may be outdated
% Instead, provide a clear summary of the research goals + pre-registration
% Especially for quantitative content
None of the evaluated papers explicitly stated their research questions, but all included an overarching goal for their research. Even without explicit research questions, all papers had a clear connection between this goal and their result and conclusion. As such, some may argue that research questions are outdated, and that it is more important to include a clear summary of the overarching goal and contributions. While there are no clear connections between the use of research questions and paper quality, including such questions could lead to better readability, and help mitigate the problem of "publish or perish" by creating a source for pre-registration, as well as by making it easier for readers to quickly assess the relevancy of a paper for their own research.
