This is now an abstract. It is, in fact, very long, long enough that it goes over multiple lines of text, as well as multiple, well, not exactly multiple pages, necessarily, but at least multiple lines, that is absolutely, undoubtedly, fully and completely true and certain and sure as a rock in the desert, as long at it is a large rock and not one of those small pebbles that gets picked up by the wind and thrown towards random passersby as they, well, pass by.
