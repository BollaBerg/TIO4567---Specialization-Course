The problem of "publish or perish" is increasingly impacting academic trustworthiness in the eyes of the public, as well as academia itself, through decreasing reproducibility of research and increasing volumes of papers being produced. This paper looks at three diverse papers within the field of responsible artificial intelligence, and evaluate them using a set of criteria related to research questions. I find that the use of research questions is limited, but see clear connections between the papers and their overarching research goals, suggesting that research questions are possibly used without being mentioned in the papers. I conclude by drawing connections between the use of research questions and paper quality, while considering alternative methods for increasing quality, such as including a structured summary of contributions in the introduction of the paper.

This paper contributes to the field of academic writing by examining the connection between research questions and paper quality, as well as suggesting paths for future work on research questions.
